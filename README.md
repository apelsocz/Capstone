### Android Developer Nanodegree
# Vendship (Capstone)
## Project Overview
This projects replicates the process of professional Android Development by allowing students to create and build an app of their own design.

The first stage is to design and plan the app, receiving feedback before building to prevent and mitigate pain points.

Next, students apply the knowledge of different concepts and components learned throughout the Nanodegree to bring the app idea to life.

## Why this Project?
Being a proficient Android Developer requires designing and planning how to implement features. By the end of the project, students will produce an app which can be submitted to the Google Play Store for distribution.

## Learning Outcomes
- Communicate an app idea formally
- Planning required tasks sequentially
- Own the full development cycle of an app
